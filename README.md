# jBREAD

**jBread** is a simple interpreted programming I'm creating to learn more about
interpretors and how to design them. I probably won't fully complete this project
to be a functional language, but I have hopes that I'll make it atleast usable
upto some extent.

I'm making this with the reference from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).
The examples and references in this book are written in Java, I'm porting them to rust while
adding a bit of my own language flavour to it.
